# Checkpoints and /rewind

Wizard snapshots the file behind every `write_file` and `edit_file` call, per turn, so a
turn (or a run of turns) can be rewound: files restored to their before-state and the
conversation truncated to match. There are no approval prompts anywhere in this: every
tool call still executes directly; checkpoints are the undo, not a gate.

**What this does not cover.** Only those two tools are snapshotted. A file changed by a
shell command through `execute`, by an MCP or scripted tool, by `generate_image`, or by
`/evolve` is not recorded, and a rewind will not put it back. Wizard's own edits are
undoable; everything Wizard *ran* is not.

## How it works

Before an edit-class tool (`write_file`, `edit_file` — the only two that declare edit
access) runs, and after pre-tool hooks have
had their chance to rewrite the arguments, the dispatcher copies the target file's
current content into the project's checkpoint store. Subagent edits go through the same
seam, snapshotted under the parent's current turn. The first snapshot of a path within a
turn wins: that is the turn's before-state, no matter how many times the turn rewrites
the file. A tool about to create a new file records that instead, so a rewind deletes
the file.

Snapshotting is best-effort by design: a checkpoint failure is logged and the tool call
proceeds. The agent can always work; it just might not be rewindable.

### Why not shadow-git

The repo Wizard runs in may be edited concurrently by other processes (other agents,
editors, builds). A git-based snapshot would capture and restore *their* changes too.
Copy-on-write snapshots only ever touch files Wizard itself modified.

## On disk

```
<project>/.wizard/checkpoints/
  index.jsonl        one record per snapshot: {turn, tool, path, snap, existed_before}
  <turn>/<n>.snap    copied file contents
```

Turn ids are monotonic per project (they continue across sessions). Corrupt index lines
are skipped on load. Like the rest of `.wizard/` (plan.md, mission.toml), the directory
is plain files you can inspect or delete.

## /rewind (TUI)

```
/rewind          # open the turn picker
/rewind 12       # rewind directly to before turn 12
```

The picker lists the 20 most recent turns, newest first, each with its turn number, the
first line of the prompt that started it (capped at 120 characters), and the base names
of the files its edits touched. ↑/↓ select, Enter rewinds, Esc cancels. `/rewind` also
runs in the window, where it answers with a notice naming the turn it went back to and
the files it restored.

Rewinding to turn N:

- restores every snapshot from turn N onward (the earliest before-state of each file
  wins), and files that did not exist before are deleted;
- truncates the session file at turn N's marker and reloads the in-memory conversation,
  so the model no longer remembers the rewound turns;
- prunes the rewound turns from the checkpoint store.

Session files carry one turn-marker line per turn for this; older session files without
markers still load (they just cannot anchor a conversation truncation).

## Perpetual rollback

```toml
# ~/.wizard/config.toml
rollback_failed_cycles = true   # default false
```

When a headless run ends in a circuit breaker or a hard error, the cycle's file edits are
restored before the run ends. This applies to any sovereign run, not only `--continuous`;
the note in the mission's progress log (`.wizard/mission.toml`) is the continuous-only
part, because that is where a mission exists. Restoration is best-effort — a failure is
logged and the run still ends. Off by default: a failed cycle's partial work is sometimes
worth keeping.

## Retention

```toml
[checkpoints]
keep_turns = 50   # default
```

`keep_turns = 0` keeps **none**: every snapshot is collected at session start
and `/rewind` has nothing to restore from. It is not a synonym for unlimited,
which is the likeliest way to misread a zero, and the mistake is silent — it
takes effect the moment a session opens, long before you want to rewind. There
is no unlimited setting; a large number is how you say "effectively never".

Snapshots of all but the most recent `keep_turns` turns are garbage-collected when the
agent is built — at session start, and again whenever the agent is rebuilt (`/model`
and `/provider`; `/reload` swaps the tool registry on the existing agent and does not
build one). It is idempotent, so the repeat costs nothing.
