//! Hierarchical project instructions.
//!
//! Wizard composes its "project instructions" prompt section from every
//! directory between the filesystem root and the project root: in each
//! directory the first of `WIZARD.md` > `AGENTS.md` > `CLAUDE.md` is taken,
//! plus the global `~/.wizard/WIZARD.md`. Files are concatenated outermost
//! first (global, then root-down), so the project root's file has the last
//! word. Each file may pull in extra context with `@relative/path` lines
//! (one level deep, capped per include, and confined to the including file's
//! own directory subtree unless it is the user's own global file, see
//! [`resolve_include`] and [`Includes`]); the assembled block is capped as a
//! whole so a sprawling hierarchy cannot flood the context window.
