//! `wizard resume`: reopen a conversation, optionally one that belongs to
//! Claude Code.
//!
//! # Why this is not part of [`crate::claude_session`]
//!
//! That module parses `~/.claude` and is forbidden to write. Its
//! `no_write_api_reachable_from_this_module` test greps the module's own
//! source and fails the build if a single filesystem write API is so much as
//! named in it, because `~/.claude` is another program's live state: a write
//! from Wizard would at best race Claude Code appending to the file and at
//! worst destroy a conversation the user cannot get back. A runtime assertion
//! cannot see a write a *future* edit introduces, which is why the property is
//! enforced against the source text rather than at runtime.
//!
//! The import needs Wizard's session writer, so putting it in
//! [`crate::claude_session`] would mean either weakening that guard or
//! laundering the write through an indirection until the grep stopped seeing
//! it. Both defeat the point. It lives here instead: this module may write,
//! and everything it writes lands under `~/.wizard/sessions/`. The only thing
//! it does to `~/.claude` is read it.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`prepare`] is the entry point [`crate::run`] dispatches through. It turns
//! `wizard resume […]` into the plain `--resume` invocation it is equivalent
//! to, doing the Claude Code import on the way when `--claude` is given, and
//! the caller then falls through into the normal run. `to_chat_messages` is
//! the conversion itself and is the part with decisions in it; the rest is a
//! picker.
