//! Cross-process exclusive locks, held on a named file.
//!
//! Two wizards on one machine share `~/.wizard`, and more than one thing in
//! there is rewritten whole: the trust store is read entirely, edited, and
//! renamed into place. Nothing in that sequence is atomic *across* processes,
//! so the second rename drops whatever the first one added, and a user who
//! answered "yes, trust this project" in one terminal is asked again in the
//! other with no explanation. An in-process `Mutex` cannot help; the two
//! writers are not in one process.
//!
//! Unix answers with `flock(2)`: an advisory lock attached to an open file
//! description, released when the descriptor closes, which the kernel does on
//! exit, on panic and on SIGKILL alike. That last property is why this is a
//! lock and not a lock *file*: there is no stale-lock cleanup to get wrong,
//! because a dead holder cannot leave one behind. Windows has `LockFileEx`,
//! which is the same shape (a handle held open, released when it closes) with
//! a different spelling, so the surface here is "take a lock named by a path,
//! hold it in a value, drop the value to release".
//!
//! The lock deliberately sits on a *sidecar* file rather than on the store it
//! guards. The store is replaced by `rename`, and a lock held on the replaced
//! inode guards nothing: the next process opens the new inode and takes a lock
//! nobody else is holding.
